# Machine-Learning

In this repository, I am implementing multiple ML, DL and RL algorithms from scratch!

For ML, I have implemented K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-means clustring, Adaboost, Decision tree, Random Forest and etc.

For DL, I have implemented Fully-connected Network, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Generative adversarial networks, GoogleNet, ResNet, Variational Auto-Encoder, Sequence to Sequence model, and transformers! 

For RL, I have implemented A3C, DDPG, DQN, DoubleDQN, Dueling DQN, Double Dueling DQN, PPO, SAC, and TD3.
